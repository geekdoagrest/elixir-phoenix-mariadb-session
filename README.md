# Elixir Phoenix MariaDB for project with user authentication

### Setting up your Phoenix project:
From your project directory, run a command to initalize the project:

```bash
$ docker-compose run --rm web mix phx.new --no-brunch --no-html app
```
```bash
$ docker-compose run --rm web mix deps.get
```
### Setup development environment
Check file secret.env


## OBS:
I installed this image to serve as a base for the projects, in the docker we already have mysql and the starter of the phoenix running, just do the fork and start the development :)
